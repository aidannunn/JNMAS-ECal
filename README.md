CptS 422 Project 3 team respository.

This software simulates a calculator that is capable of commonly used
computations, including but not limited to basic arithmetic calculations.
Computing with real numbers needs to be supported, allowing users to control
the level of precision desired (e.g., precise up to four decimal places). Some
advanced computations could also be supported, such as power, root, triangular
calculations, and so on.
